This repository contains all source code, data, and analysis scripts related to this master thesis
conducted at the **Department of Computer Science, Technical University of Darmstadt**.

## Project Overview

This thesis investigates different interaction methods for cyclists while riding, focusing on performance, safety, and user experience.  
Four input methods were compared under real outdoor conditions:

- **Analogue Stick**
- **Tactile Buttons**
- **Direct Touch**  
- **Indirect Touch (remote touch display)**  

Each participant completed tasks using all input methods while objective (performance, gaze data) and subjective (questionnaire) measures were collected.
